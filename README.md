# CCC Fixtures — Next.js App

This repository contains a minimal Next.js app that displays club cricket fixtures in a slideshow/grid layout. It's configured with Tailwind CSS and ready for deployment to Vercel.

Getting started (Windows PowerShell):

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Deploying to Vercel:

- Connect this repository to Vercel or deploy directly from the Vercel dashboard. Vercel automatically detects Next.js projects.
- Ensure the build command is `npm run build` and the output directory is left empty (Vercel will use default settings for Next.js).
